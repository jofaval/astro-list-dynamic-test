# Todo-List with Astro

Dynamic interaction test, it's sort of a personal PoC.

## ðŸš€ Tech stack

Built using [Astro](https://astro.build) with TypeScript.

## Motivation

I'm curious to see if my React apps could be built with Astro as to minimize the initial page load, while maintaining interaction.

## Conclusions

Useful, fast, comfortable, and with a clear separation between client and server loaded.

I was looking to see if and when I could add some interactivity with React from server-rendered components, and it was a nice experience all the way through.

## Results

This repo uses Github Actions CI/CD deployment to Github Pages. The url is:
